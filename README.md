This repository contains things I like to reuse. They're generic enough that they might be useful to you too, so feel free to use them!

Check out [@stanlemon/webdev](packages/webdev/README.md) and [@stanlemon/eslint-config](packages/eslint-config/README.md) for things that might be useful.

Everything exists under the *MIT* license, so please use as you see fit. If you find a bug, please open an issue or a pull request and let me know.
